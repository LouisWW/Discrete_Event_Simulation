Discrete_Event_Simulation
-------------------------------

Different queuing systems are such as M/M/n , M/D/n and M/LT/n are modelled and 
analysed. The aim of the model is to determined the average queueing  time in the different
queueing systems. For each queueing system two different queuing disciplines were applied such as 
first in, first out (FIFO), shortest job next (SJN).
In the attached report more elaborated background information can be found.
Additionally, the methodology used in the models can be looked up. The models are
based on the Simpy package. Function.py sets up the server system of simpy. Each script 
models the queuing system by specifically varying one variable.
